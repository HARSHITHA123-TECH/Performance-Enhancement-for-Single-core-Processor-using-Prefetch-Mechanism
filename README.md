## What is Cache?
A chip-based computer component called cache memory improves the efficiency of
data retrieval from the computer’s memory. It serves as a temporary storage space from
which data can be quickly retrieved by the computer’s processor. The processor has easier
access to this temporary storage space, often called a cache, than it does to the primary
memory source of the computer, which is usually DRAM. Because it is usually installed on
a different chip with a separate bus interface from the CPU or built directly into the CPU
chip, cache memory is often referred to as CPU (central processing unit) memory. Since it
is physically close to the processor, it can therefore boost efficiency and be more accessible
to the processor.
## Levels of Cache
1. L1 cache, or primary cache: It is extremely fast but relatively small, and is usually
embedded in the processor chip as CPU cache.
2. L2 cache, or secondary cache: It has a larger capacity than L1 cache. The
L2 cache can be included within the CPU or it might reside on a different chip or
coprocessor, with a fast alternative system bus linking it to the CPU. In this manner,
traffic on the primary system bus won’t slow it down.
3. Level 3 (L3) cache: It is customized memory designed to enhance L1 and L2
performance. Although L3 is sometimes twice as fast as DRAM, L1 or L2 might be
much quicker than L3. Each core of a multicore CPU may have its own L1 and L2
cache, but they may share an L3 cache. An L3 cache is typically raised to a higher
level of cache when it references an instruction.
## Basic Operations of Cache Memory are:
• The CPU first looks through the cache for any necessary data. This is one of the
basic functions of cache memory. Additionally, if the data is in the cache, it does not
visit the main memory.
• On the other hand, the main memory is accessed if the data is not found in the cache.
• The words that the CPU is currently accessing are moved from the main memory to
the cache so they can be accessed quickly later.
• The cache memory’s performance is determined by the hit ratio.
## Prefetching
Prefetching is a performance optimization technique employed in computer systems,
particularly in the realm of memory management and cache design. Its primary goal is to
reduce the time it takes for a processor to access data by proactively fetching that data
from slower levels of memory hierarchy into faster, closer levels.
## Cache prefetching
Without cache prefetching, data is moved from lower-level memory to a register or
functional unit using explicit memory instructions, constrained by dependencies. This can
lead to delays as data may not be available when needed. Cache prefetching anticipates
data needs by speculatively moving it to higher cache levels before it’s required. Software
prefetching is compiler-controlled, using load instructions to a non-existent register. Hardware prefetching is controller-driven, generating requests based on real-time information. Both aim to reduce cache miss rates and hide latency by preparing data before it’s needed, enhancing overall processor efficiency.
## Instruction Prefetching
Instruction prefetching aims to anticipate and fetch future instructions before the
CPU needs them. Various algorithms monitor the CPU’s instruction cycle to decide which
instructions to prefetch.
### Next Line Prefetching
The next-line prefetching algorithm fetches upcoming instructions in a sequence before
the computer needs them. It’s like loading the next page of a book while you’re still reading
the current one. This helps to avoid delays, but it’s not great with decision points like
“choose your own adventure” moments in a book. The trick is to decide how far ahead
to look without looking too far and slowing things down. It’s a simple approach, though,
without needing extra fancy hardware.
Next-line prefetching is a proactive strategy used in computer architecture and memory systems to enhance performance by fetching not just the data requested but also the
next sequential line of data in advance. This approach aims to reduce memory access latency by anticipating and preloading the subsequent data into cache or memory before it is needed by the processor. The basic idea behind next-line prefetching is to exploit the principle of spatial locality, which suggests that if a program accesses a particular memory location, it is likely to access nearby memory locations in the near future. Instead of waiting for explicit requests for
subsequent data, the prefetching mechanism predicts these accesses and loads the data preemptively into the cache hierarchy. This proactive fetching strategy involves hardware mechanisms that monitor memory access patterns and predict the next sequential memory addresses that the processor is likely
to access. These predictions are based on historical patterns or algorithms that analyze the program’s behavior to estimate the next memory location that will be accessed.
## Data Prefetching
Data prefetching is a technique used in computer architecture to enhance memory
access performance by fetching data into the cache before it is explicitly requested by the
processor. The goal is to reduce memory access latency and minimize processor stalls,
thereby improving overall program execution speed.
### Next N-Line Prefetching

Next N-line prefetching is an optimization technique used in computer architecture
and memory systems to enhance performance by fetching multiple contiguous lines of data
ahead of time, beyond just the next line. Unlike traditional next-line prefetching, which
fetches only the immediately following memory line, Next N-line prefetching predicts and
preloads the next N sequential lines of data into the cache or memory before they are explicitly requested by the processor.
The fundamental idea behind Next N-line prefetching is to exploit the principle of spatial locality to an increased extent. It assumes that if a program accesses a particular memory location, it is likely to access a range of nearby memory locations in the near future. By prefetching not just the next line but ’N’ subsequent lines, the technique aims to reduce memory access latency further and make better use of available bandwidth. This proactive prefetching strategy involves hardware mechanisms that analyze memory access patterns and predict the ’N’ sequential memory addresses that the processor is likely to
access. These predictions can be based on historical patterns, algorithms, or heuristics that monitor the program’s behavior to estimate the subsequent memory locations that will be accessed.

## Conclusion
The delay experienced due to a miss penalty, which is the time taken to retrieve data
from a higher-level cache or memory upon a cache miss, relies on both the network latency
of the underlying architecture and the access time of the L2 cache in a system featuring
banked distributed caches like L1 caches. If there is no prefetcher, when a cache miss occurs,
only the specific instruction that is missing is fetched from the main memory. This results
in an increase in Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) and a decrease in Instructions Per
Cycle (IPC).
To solve this problem the paper proposes two algorithms, Next line and Next-N line.
Experimentally, it is been observed that the next line predicts which instruction to be
fetched next. Due to this, the miss rate decreases, hence leading to a decrease in AMAT
and increased IPC. Next N-line fetches N number of instructions based on the current
access instruction. The prefetched lines are loaded into the cache in anticipation of the
CPU requiring these instructions for future computation.
